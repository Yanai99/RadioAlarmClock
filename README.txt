Good day, my dear reader!

Let me introduce you to the ultimate morning hack that will make your mornings more soothing and enjoyable! This project is not just your ordinary alarm clock that beeps in your ear and jolts you awake from your peaceful slumber. Oh no, this is a clock that turns on a radio and slowly increases the volume, giving you a gentle and calm start to your day.

To make this masterpiece, you'll need Python with some essential packages such as webbrowser, datetime, requests, pyautogui, time, and serial. But that's not all, folks! You'll also require an Arduino UNO, a servo, and an LED (optional) to control the volume slowly and to let you know that the clock is indeed working its magic.

The Python program will open the radio and press play, while the Arduino servo will increase the volume slowly, creating a beautiful symphony that will make waking up a treat. And if you're curious about the nitty-gritty details, we have a schematic that will guide you through the process.

So there you have it, a morning hack that will make waking up less of a chore and more of a joy. Now, what are you waiting for? Start building and have a blast!
